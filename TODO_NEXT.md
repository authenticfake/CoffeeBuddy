# FINALIZE

## Backlog
- Automate reminder backfill after Kafka outages (currently manual via CLI).
- Add synthetic Slack workspace tests in CI to validate interactive block rendering.
- Expand observability with trace IDs and alert thresholds for reminder lag.
- Provide self-serve channel analytics (basic run history export) for office managers.

## Assumptions
- Priorities will be revisited once pilot feedback is collected; list reflects highest-impact gaps today.
